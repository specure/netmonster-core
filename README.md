# NetMonster Core

Lightweight Android library that is build over [Telephony SDK](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/package-summary). NetMonster core is extracted from [NetMonster](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cz.mroczis.netmonster) application and backports several Telephony features to older Android devices.  
  
Why use NetMonster Core instead of legacy API?  
 - Validation - library validates data from RIL and corrects them if possible 
 - Richer information - additional functions for cell identity and cell signal that will make your code more understandable  
 - Backport - several non-accessible signal or identity fields are now accessible without boilerplate code  
 - Tested - tested on real devices, 50 000+ active users

### Usage

There are basically two ways you can use this library - as a validation library that will sanitize
data from AOSP cause lots of manufacturers modify source code and do not follow public documentation.
In that case you'll only need `ITelephonyManagerCompat` to retrieve AOSP-like models that are properly
validated.

The second option is to use advantages of additional postprocessing of NetMonster Core. As a result
you'll get more data but correctness is not 100 % guaranteed. 

#### Without additional postprocessing

NetMonster Core focuses on mapping of two AOSP's ways to fetch current cell information:
 - [TelephonyManager.getAllCellInfo()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager#getAllCellInfo())
 - [TelephonyManager.getCellLocation()](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telephony/TelephonyManager.html#getCellLocation()) (deprecated in AOSP)
 - TelephonyManager.getNeighbouringCellInfo() (removed from AOSP)

Note that some of those methods are deprecated or even removed from AOSP - for more info see documentation of each method.

```kotlin
NetMonsterFactory.getTelephony(context, SUBSCRIPTION_ID).apply {
    val allCellInfo : List<ICell> = getAllCellInfo() 
    val cellLocation : List<ICell> = getCellLocation()
    val neighbouringCells : List<ICell> = getNeighbouringCellInfo()
}
```

#### Postprocessing

In this case you'll need to interact with `INetMonster` class. Here's list of problems 
that this library solves.

##### Merging data from multiple sources
Issue:
 - Android offers multiple ways how to get cell information.
 - Not all devices support one unified way how to access all the data.

Solution:
 - NetMonster Core grabs data from sources you specify, validates and merges them.

```kotlin
NetMonsterFactory.get(context).apply {
    val allSources : List<ICell> = getCells() // all sources
    val subset : List<ICell> = getCells( // subset of available sources
        CellSource.ALL_CELL_INFO, 
        CellSource.CELL_LOCATION
    ) 
}
```

##### Detection of LTE-A & HSPA+42
Issue:
 - AOSP cannot detect HSPA+42, only HSPA+.
 - AOSP does not offer a way to distinguish whether current network is using carrier aggregation or not.

Solution:
 - NetMonster Core attempts to guess HSPA+ 42 availability.
 - LTE-CA presence can be guessed based on cell info or detected using hidden APIs.

Using `getNetworkType(vararg detectors: INetworkDetector)` you can specify which `INetworkDetector` to use
when detecting current network type.

```kotlin
NetMonsterFactory.get(context).apply {
    // All detectors that are bundled in NetMonster Core
    val networkType : NetworkType = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
    
    // Only HSPA+42 (guess, not from RIL)
    val isHspaDc: NetworkType? = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, DetectorHspaDc())
    // LTE-A from CellInfo (guess, not from RIL), NSA NR
    val isLteCaCellInfo: NetworkType? = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, DetectorCellInfo())
    // LTE-A from ServiceState (from RIL, Android P+)
    val isLteCaServiceState: NetworkType? = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, DetectorLteAdvancedNrServiceState())
    // LTE-A from PhysicalChannel (from RIL, Android P+)
    val isLteCaPhysicalChannel: NetworkType? = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, DetectorLteAdvancedPhysicalChannel())
    // LTE-A and NR from DisplayInfo (marketing purposes, might result false-positive data, Android R+)
    // You can also detect only LTE-A or NR using one of classes:
    // - DetectorLteAdvancedServiceState ... for LTE-A
    // - DetectorNsaNr ... for NR NSA
    val isLteCaOrNsaNrDisplayInfo: NetworkType? = getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID, DetectorLteAdvancedNrDisplayInfo())
}
```

##### Detection of NR NSA
Issue:
 - AOSP does not provide any information about NR NSA connection status.
 - The only official available information is in `TelephonyDisplayInfo` which provide inaccurate (marketing-based) data.

Solution:
 - In order to obtain detailed connection info about NR NSA you need to get `NetworkType` instance.
```kotlin
val networkType : NetworkType = NetMonsterFactory.get(context).getNetworkType(SUBSCRIPTION_ID)
if (networkType is NetworkType.Nr.Nsa) {
    val state: NrNsaState = networkType.nrNsaState // For more info refer to NrNsaState class
}
```

##### Other features
 - Detection of serving cells in 'emergency calls only' mode.
 - PLMN addition to non-serving cells in GSM, WCDMA, LTE, TD-SCDMA and NR networks.
